I have worked at <a href="https://www.callaghaninnovation.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Callaghan Innovation</a> as a research assistant during a summer scholarship. I have worked for Snapper Services Ltd as an intern. I have operated as a contractor, developing software primarily for <a href="http://epi-interactive.com" target="_blank">Epi-interactive</a>. My last few years have been spent working in the Platform Engineering space at a large multi-national business.

<h3 class="header-underline">What are your skills?</h3>

<h4>Cloud</h4>
I've been working with Amazon cloud in my last three workplaces. I've worked with a fair amount of event driven architecture using AWS services. And tackled the problems which come at scale. I've been working with Infrastructure as Code using Terraform for a few years, and even built and contributed to a couple or Terraform providers, including the AWS one. All non-legacy code
I have deployed has been on either ECS of Kubernetes.

<h4>C#</h4>
When coding, I've spent the last few years primarily working in dotnet. I've maintained legacy code bases in .NET Framework and built SDKs and migration libraries to help teams transition their legacy code bases to use new services in the interim. I've also worked on new projects in .NET Core 2.1-3.1 and .NET 5.

<h4>GoLang</h4>
I first got introduced to Go in university at around 2014. I wasn't convinced until I was lucky enough to use it in a team.
That was when I discovered how much of a joy it was to use. It truly feels like a microservice language designed to solve modern problems which come at scale. I also ended up on a team creating a Tier One central service written in Go.

<h4>Interpersonal</h4>
I'm a strong believer in having a cohesive team who can feel safe and open around each other. I encourage an environment in which vulnerability is a strength. I'm open to constructive criticism and will provide appropriate feedback to those I work with.

Do you have more projects other than those listed?

Yes! I absolutely do! But I've only put ones which I'm allowed to discuss and deem to be interesting on this website.

What made you want to be a software engineer?

I've been interested in computers and technology since I was a wee lad. I've always had an interest in figuring out how
they work under the hood. So when I figured out how to program my Casio fx-9750G Plus with basic games, I was hooked. I studied C# at
high school, where I found out how much I enjoyed programming, this appreciation of software led me to make the decision
to study software engineering at VUW.

And what is it that interests you?

Well geez... that's a pretty general question, but I enjoy skiing, so much so that I haven't gone a year without it since I started at the age of six. I like swimming, hitting the gym, and travel.
I also enjoy my video games and movies, pretty typical nerd stuff.

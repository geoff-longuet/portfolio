EPI-interactive were tasked with developing an application for the University of Minnesota to analyse animal health data.

The tool is built in Shiny and R.

My responsibilities were as follows:

- Creating the reactive user interface from mockups
- Real-time server-side filtering and updating of leaflet maps for space-time analysis

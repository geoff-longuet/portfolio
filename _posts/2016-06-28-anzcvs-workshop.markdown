I was tasked by Epi-interactive to develop a basic web application to help teach people basic data visualisation tools
at Science Week in Australia.
Some technologies used were:

- R
- Shiny Server
- Google fusion tables
- Google charts
- Google Maps
- Leaflet
- MapQuest Geocoding API

Using this web application I broke it down into stages and wrote documentation for a future presentation.

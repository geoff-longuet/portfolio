This was a fun project sent out to Epi-interactive clients. It contains information about where the team had travelled
throughout 2016 and the statistics surrounding their journeys.

The project is built without a JavaScript framework like AngularJS and without a front-end framework like Bootstrap.
I decided early on that they were unnecessary for such a compact project and would only increase page load times.

As the data wasn't finalised during the build process, I created easy to update JSON data files. Modifying these
will cause the tool to update animations, timings, locations, text, and statistics accordingly.

"Fun" challenges included the Internet Explorer SVG scaling bug, ensuring compatibility down to Internet Explorer 7, and
making the whole thing work on mobile devices.

I was the sole developer on this project, working in close collaboration with the designer.

Packages I used from NPM:

- Gulp - to handle building (merging, minifcation, copying assets).
- Modernizr - ensuring that the app works on old browsers through feature detection.
- Leaflet - for the awesome mapping capabilities.
- HTML5 boilerplate - for CSS resets and basic Gulp config.
- D3 - For animated graphs.

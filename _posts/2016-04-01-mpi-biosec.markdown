caption: "Moving from flash to HTML5 with AngularJS"
---
When I was first brought on as a contractor to Epi-interactive, I was tasked with creating a responsive HTML5 interactive tool for the Ministry for Primary Industries.
The original tool was produced in flash, given that this technology is practically unusable on mobile devices and is fast becoming obsolete on desktops, a switch was necessary.

I was the sole developer of this application.

My responsibilities were as follows:

- Extracting information from flash source.
- Creating visually similar, but modernised and responsive components in HTML.
- Creating reusable Angular directives for simple modification.

The tool is built using Yeoman with the AngularJS generator. It makes use of libraries from NPM such as:

- Raphael
- AngularUI Bootstrap
- jsPDF
